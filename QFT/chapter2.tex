Problem 1.\\
Classical electromagnetism (with no sources) follows from the action \\
\[S =  \int (-\frac{1}{4}F_{uv}F^{uv})\,d^{4}x, \ \ where \ \  F_{uv} = \partial_{u}A_{v} - \partial_{v}A_{u}. \]
(a) Derive Maxwell's equations as the Euler-Lagrange equations of this action, treating the components $A_{u}$(x) as the dynamical variables. Write the equations in standard form by identifying $E^{i}$ = - $F^{0i}$ and

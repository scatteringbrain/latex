Problem 1. \\ \\ 
Solve Equation 3.1 for x, y, z, t in terms of x', y', z', t', and check that you recover Equation 3.3. \\ \\

Solution \\ \\
Equation 3.1 \\\\
i. x' = $\gamma$(x - vt)\\
ii. y' = y\\
iii. z' = z\\
iv. t' = $\gamma$(t - $\frac{v}{c^{2}}$x)\\ \\
Equation 3.3 \\\\
i'. x = $\gamma$(x' + vt')\\
ii'. y = y' \\
iii'. z = z' \\
iv'. t = $\gamma$(t' + $\frac{v}{c^{2}}$x')\\ \\

i', ii' , iii' are obvious. \\ 

for iv', from iv, \\\\ t = $\frac{v}{c^{2}}$x + $\frac{t'}{\gamma}$ \\
= $\frac{1}{\gamma}$(t' + $\frac{\gamma}{c^{2}}$v($\frac{x'}{\gamma}$+vt))\\
 = $\frac{1}{\gamma}$(t' + $\frac{\gamma}{c^{2}}$v($\frac{x'}{\gamma}$)+$\frac{v^{2}\gamma t}{c^{2}}$)\\ \\
t(1-$\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}$) = $\frac{1}{\gamma}$(t'+$\frac{vx'}{c^{2}}$) \\ \\
Therefore,   t = $\gamma$(t'+$\frac{vx'}{c^{2}}$)\\\\
This is the iv'. \\ \\ \\

Problem 2. \\ \\ 
(a) Derive Equation 3.4. \\
(b) According to clocks on the ground (system S), streetlights A and B (situated 4km apart) were both turned on at precisely 8:00 P.M. which one went on first according to an observer on a train (system S'), which moves from A toward B at $\frac{3}{5}$ the speed of light? How much later (in seconds) did the other light go on? Note: As always in relativity, we are talking here about what S' observed, after correcting for the time it took the light to reach her, not what she actually saw ( which would depend on where she was located on the train). \\ \\

Solution for (a)\\ \\

From Equation 3.1 iv. t' = $\gamma$(t-$\frac{v}{c^{2}}$x), \\ \\
$t'_{a}$ =  $\gamma$($t_{a}$-$\frac{v}{c^{2}}$ $x_{a}$),\\ \\
$t'_{b}$ =  $\gamma$($t_{b}$-$\frac{v}{c^{2}}$ $x_{b}$),\\ \\
$t'_{b}$ - $t'_{a}$ = $\gamma$($t_{b}$ - $t_{a}$ - $\frac{v}{c^{2}}$ $x_{a}$ + $\frac{v}{c^{2}}$ $x_{b}$)\\ \\
Here, $t_{b}$ = $t_{a}$ by the condition, and $x_{a}$ $\neq$ $x_{b}$, \\ \\ 
So, $t'_{a}$ = $t'_{b}$ + $\frac{\gamma v}{c^{2}}$($x_{b}$ - $x_{a}$) \\ \\ 

Solution for (b) \\ \\ 
1) The streetlight B will go on first. \\
2) $t'_{a}$ = $t'_{b}$ + $\frac{\gamma v}{c^{2}}$($x_{b}$ - $x_{a}$) from (a),\\
\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\]
v = $\frac{3}{5}$c $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$ = $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$ \\
\[t'_{b} - t'_{a} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\frac{3}{5} \frac{4\times10^{3}}{3\times10^{8}}s\]
